# Learning project

This learning project showcases a clone of Flask; Vibora

Vibora is a lot faster, similar API, completly async and is rated [the 4th fastest framework of the web](https://github.com/tbrand/which_is_the_fastest)!


# Goal

As it is a personal project, my main goal is to learn more about:

    - Vibora
    - Creating database abstractions
    - Creating a clean testable architecture.
    - Using docker to create testable environments
    - Seperate dev, test, stage and prod environments using docker
    - And maybe create a starter template from this eventually..



### TODO:

    - ORM like objects with relations
    - Maybe complete API abstraction with DSL
    - Autogenerated API docs
    - Basic frontend
    - Integration tests
    - Coverage reporting
    - CI
    - A lot..
